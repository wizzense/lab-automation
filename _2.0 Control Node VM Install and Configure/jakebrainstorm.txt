Writing my thoughts in pseudocode dont mind me




Next Steps?
    Install OpenTofu on the system - will probably want to automate this w script?
    Create a config file (.tf extension) to define the infrastructure. Maybe look something like this?

provider "hyperv" {
  # Configuration for the Hyper-V provider
}

resource "hyperv_virtual_machine" "tanium_vm" {
  name             = "tanium-vm"
  memory           = 2048
  virtual_processors = 2
  vhd_path         = "C:\\path\\to\\your\\vm\\image.vhdx"
  switch_name      = "Default Switch"
  iso_path           = "C:\\path\\to\\your\\iso\\image.iso"  # Path to the ISO file? Not certain how it works
}


would probably feed it iso files we downloaded previously

Could maybe use cloud.init to automate the configuration of VMs after provisioned by OpenTofu
